# sonos-challenge
This project was done at University of Washington in two weeks under the initiative of professor Les Atlas in collaboration with Sonos.
It was submitted on the 1st of December 2017.
We created a speaker recognition engine based on an LSTM deep learning network focusing on using as few training samples as possible.
You can find details of our implementation in the project pdf.
